# EE422C_A4
We created 4 new classes which are our Critter 1 through 4 and all of them have the following methods:
  - toString()
  - fight()
  - doTime()
  - runStats()
 Our class worldTimeStep calls these classes and invokes them in their appropiate order. No new classes where implemented
 besides the ones decribed above. Instead new method were created in the Critter class.
